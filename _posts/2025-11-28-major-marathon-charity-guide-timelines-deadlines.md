<p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;">Dreaming of running a World Marathon Major but don't have a qualifying time—or struck out in the lottery? Charity entries are often the most reliable way in. This guide covers fundraising minimums, application windows, and key deadlines for all six majors.</p>

Below is a **practical, race-by-race guide** to how charity bibs work for the big six: Boston, New York City, Chicago, Berlin, London, and Tokyo. Fundraising minimums and timelines change every year, so treat this as a **pattern guide**, not a legal document—always confirm details with the race and your chosen charity.

## Boston Marathon (April)

Boston is both the hardest to qualify for and one of the most expensive to access via charity.

### How Charity Entry Works

The Boston Athletic Association (B.A.A.) runs an **Official Charity Program** that gives invitational entries to ~190+ nonprofit organizations for the 2026 race. Those organizations then recruit runners who commit to a fundraising minimum.

### Typical Fundraising Minimums

Minimums vary by charity, but current examples include:

- The B.A.A.'s own charity team requires at least **US$8,500** for the 2024–2025 cycle.
- Another Boston Marathon charity, Trinity Boston Connects, also sets an **US$8,500** minimum.
- Some high-profile charities set **US$20,000** minimums for their Boston teams.

Realistically, you should expect **US$7,500–$10,000+**, and be prepared for considerably more with certain organizations.

### Key Timelines & Deadlines

- Boston typically announces its **Official Charity Program list** for a given year in early fall (e.g., October for the following April).
- Individual charities open applications on their own schedules but often **recruit from fall through early winter** for the race the following April.
- Many ask you to hit certain **interim milestones** (e.g., 50–80% of your goal before race day), with final deadlines a few weeks after the race.

## TCS New York City Marathon (November)

NYC might be the most charity-friendly of all the majors in terms of structure and communication.

### How Charity Entry Works

NYRR (New York Road Runners) runs an **Official Charity Partner Program** with different partner levels. Each charity sets its own fundraising minimum, but NYRR requires that minimum to be **at least US$3,500 per runner**.

### Typical Fundraising Minimums

Examples from current 2025–2026 charity teams:

- Many official charities list **US$3,000–$3,500** minimums.
- Some large hospital foundations and marquee nonprofits require **US$5,000+**.

So in practice, plan for **US$3,500–$5,000** as a realistic band.

### Key Timelines & Deadlines

- The **non-guaranteed entry drawing (lottery)** for NYC usually runs in **February** (e.g., Feb 11–25 for the 2025 race), with results announced in early March.
- Charity partners often start recruiting:
    - Early in the year (some before the lottery), and
    - More aggressively **after lottery results**, targeting runners who didn't get in.
- Many charities require:
    - 50% or so of your minimum by late summer/early fall,
    - Full amount due in the weeks leading up to race day.

## Bank of America Chicago Marathon (October)

Chicago offers one of the **lowest fundraising minimums** among the majors, making it a popular first charity marathon.

### How Charity Entry Works

The Chicago Marathon has an **Official Charity Program**. Only charities in this program get guaranteed entries for their runners.

### Typical Fundraising Minimums

- The official program requires each participant to raise **at least US$2,200**, though individual charities may set higher goals.
- Some charities list US$2,500 or more as their required minimum.

Expect **US$2,200–$2,500** as your baseline.

### Key Timelines & Deadlines

- The 2025 Chicago Marathon is on **October 12, 2025**, with the 2026 edition on **October 11, 2026**.
- The general application window for non-charity entries can close months before the race; when that's done, **charity entries remain one of the last ways in.**
- Many charities close applications in **late winter or early spring** for the following October race, or sooner once their bib allotment is spoken for.

## BMW Berlin Marathon (September)

Berlin is popular for its fast course and for being relatively accessible via charity compared to Boston or London.

### How Charity Entry Works

The Berlin Marathon works with **official charity partners**. Runners who choose an official partner get a **guaranteed starting place** in exchange for meeting that charity's fundraising target.

### Typical Fundraising Minimums

Minimums vary widely depending on the organization and country, but examples include:

- ASAN's (Autistic Self Advocacy Network) team for the **2026 Berlin Marathon** sets a **US$3,500** fundraising minimum.
- Other charities such as the Michael J. Fox Foundation and Free to Run set their own targets, generally in the **US$3,000–$4,000** range or equivalent.

### Key Timelines & Deadlines

- Charity places typically open once the **general registration/lottery** process is defined for a given year.
- Many international charity partners recruit **9–12 months before race day**, with fundraising milestones spread through the spring and summer.

## TCS London Marathon (April)

London is legendary for charity running. It regularly sets global records for one-day fundraising.

### How Charity Entry Works

Runners can get into London by:

- Public ballot
- Good for Age (UK only)
- Travel partners
- **Charity places**

Charities receive an allocation of bibs and recruit runners who commit to fundraising targets.

### Typical Fundraising Minimums

London charity minimums are usually quoted in pounds:

- Some major UK charities list **£2,000–£2,500** as their minimum fundraising target for a charity place.
- Others go higher; for example, some teams set **£3,000** (or US$5,000 for US-based charity teams).
- A few have lower or "raise what you can" expectations for runners who already have a ballot place.

A safe planning band is **£2,000–£3,000+** for a charity-place runner.

### Key Timelines & Deadlines

- The **public ballot** for the next London Marathon typically opens **right after the current year's race** and stays open for about a week. For 2026, for example, media reports point to an April 26–May 2, 2025 window, with results notified in July.
- Many charities:
    - Open their application forms soon after the ballot closes.
    - Allocate places gradually from mid-year through the winter.
    - Require multiple fundraising milestones (e.g., 25% by January, 80% by race day).

## Tokyo Marathon (March)

Tokyo is the most structurally different: the charity process happens **before** the general lottery and works more like a **silent auction**.

### How Charity Entry Works

- The Tokyo Marathon Charity Program lets runners choose from dozens of participating organizations and pledge a donation.
- For the 2026 race, the program lists **39 organizations**, with a **minimum donation of JPY 100,000** to become a charity runner.
- In practice, runners "bid" a donation amount; higher commitments and strong personal statements often improve your chances of being selected. Runners and bloggers describe it as a "silent auction" style system, with typical successful bids exceeding the minimum.

### Typical Fundraising Minimums

- **Minimum required donation:** JPY 100,000 (about US$650–$700, depending on exchange rates).
- Many charities set "recommended" or typical donation levels much higher, often **JPY 150,000–250,000+**, and some popular charities see accepted bids around **JPY 200,000 or more** in recent years.

You can fundraise that money back from others, but from Tokyo's perspective, **you are personally committing to donate** that amount.

### Key Timelines & Deadlines

- The Tokyo Marathon charity entry window typically runs for a few weeks in **late June to mid-July** (e.g., June 26–July 13 for the 2024 cycle).
- After charity runners are selected and donations confirmed, the **general lottery** for non-charity entries takes place later.
- Payment deadlines are strict; if you don't complete your donation within the specified period (often within ~45 days), you can lose your spot.

## How to Use This Guide

A few practical tips to make this guide actually useful:

### 1. Pick your race, then work backwards.

Start from the race date (e.g., April for Boston/London, November for NYC) and note when lottery and charity windows usually open.

### 2. Estimate your fundraising capacity.

- First-time fundraisers might aim for Chicago or Berlin.
- Experienced fundraisers with strong networks might tackle Boston, Tokyo, or London.

### 3. Research 3–5 charities per race.

Look up:

- Their **fundraising minimum**
- Whether they offer **coaching, events, or fundraising support**
- How competitive their application process is (many ask detailed questions about your "why" and your fundraising plan).

### 4. Watch for milestones and deadlines.

A lot of charities now require:

- A percentage of your goal by a mid-campaign date
- Full amount by race week or within a set time after race day

### 5. Keep your story at the center.

As Robin's Tokyo experience shows, your **personal connection to the cause** and the quality of your written application can matter just as much as the number you commit to.
