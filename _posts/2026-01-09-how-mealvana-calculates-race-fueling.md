*Ever wondered why Mealvana recommends 75 grams of carbs per hour for your long bike ride but only 55 for your marathon? Or why your sodium targets are different from your training partner's? Let's pull back the curtain on the sports science that powers your personalized fueling recommendations.*

---

## The Short Version

Your fueling needs aren't one-size-fits-all. They depend on:

- **How long** you're exercising
- **How hard** you're working
- **What sport** you're doing (bike vs. run vs. swim)
- **Your body** (sweat rate, gut tolerance, weight)
- **The conditions** (heat, humidity, altitude)

Mealvana combines decades of peer-reviewed sports nutrition research with your personal profile to generate recommendations tailored specifically to you. Here's how it all works.

## Part 1: Carbohydrates — Your Engine's Fuel

### Why Carbs Matter

During endurance exercise, your muscles burn a mix of carbohydrates and fat. The harder you go, the more you rely on carbs. A 2.5-hour workout at moderate-to-hard intensity can burn through 300-500 grams of stored carbohydrate (glycogen) — and your body can only store about 400-500 grams total [(Coyle, 2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212750/).

**The math is simple:** If you don't replace carbs during long or hard efforts, you'll bonk.

### The 60 g/hr Ceiling (And How to Break It)

Here's something fascinating that researchers discovered: **your gut can only absorb about 60 grams of a single type of carbohydrate per hour**, no matter how much you consume.

This finding has been replicated across dozens of studies. As Dr. Asker Jeukendrup summarized in his landmark 2004 review: *"A single CHO ingested during exercise will be oxidized at rates up to about 1 g/min, even when large amounts of CHO are ingested"* [(Jeukendrup, 2004, *Nutrition*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212750/).

Why? It comes down to intestinal transporters — specialized proteins that shuttle sugar from your gut into your bloodstream. The main transporter for glucose (called SGLT1) maxes out at roughly 1 gram per minute [(Jeukendrup & Jentjens, 2000, *Sports Medicine*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10870863/).

**But here's the game-changer:** Fructose uses a *different* transporter (GLUT5). By combining glucose and fructose, you can essentially open a second absorption lane.

| Carb Source | Max Absorption Rate | Research |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Glucose only | ~60 g/hr | [Jeukendrup, 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15212750/) |
| Glucose + Fructose | 90-105 g/hr | [Jentjens & Jeukendrup, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15877900/) |
| Trained gut + optimal ratio | Up to 120 g/hr | [Hearris et al., 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35514294/) |

This is why most sports nutrition products now use glucose:fructose blends (often listed as maltodextrin + fructose). The research from Jentjens & Jeukendrup (2005) showed that athletes can oxidize up to **105 g/hr** with the right carb mix — representing a 75% increase over single-source carbohydrate [(Jentjens & Jeukendrup, 2005, *British Journal of Nutrition*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15877900/).

More recent work has pushed this further. Hearris and colleagues (2022) demonstrated that **120 g/hr is practically tolerable** for athletes with trained guts using an optimized 1:0.8 glucose:fructose ratio [(Hearris et al., 2022)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35514294/).

### The Optimal Carbohydrate Ratio

Not all glucose:fructose ratios are equal. The research has evolved:

- **2:1 ratio (glucose:fructose):** Optimal for intakes up to 90 g/hr [(Jeukendrup, 2008, *European Journal of Sport Science*)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17461390801918971)
- **1:0.8 ratio:** Better for intakes of 90-120 g/hr, with improved GI comfort [(Rowlands et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25202917/)

This ratio matters because fructose absorption can become the bottleneck at very high intake rates. Elite marathon runner Eliud Kipchoge reportedly uses a 1:0.8 ratio for his record attempts.

### How Mealvana Calculates Your Carb Targets

We use duration and intensity as the primary drivers, following the evidence-based guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine and International Olympic Committee consensus statements [(Thomas et al., 2016, *Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26920240/):

**Base Recommendations by Duration:**

| Workout Duration | Carb Target | Scientific Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Under 60 min | 0-30 g total | Glycogen stores sufficient; mouth rinse approach may help [(Carter et al., 2004)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15570150/) |
| 60-90 min | 30-60 g/hr | Maintains blood glucose [(Burke et al., 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21916794/) |
| 90 min - 2.5 hr | 45-60 g/hr | Delays glycogen depletion |
| 2.5 - 4 hr | 60-90 g/hr | Requires multiple transportable carbs [(Jeukendrup, 2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24791914/) |
| 4+ hr | 80-100+ g/hr | Maximum sustainable; must include real food [(Pfeiffer et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775906/) |

*Sources: [Burke et al., 2011, Journal of Sports Sciences](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21916794/); [Jeukendrup, 2014, Sports Medicine](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24791914/); [Thomas et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26920240/)*

**Your Personal Modifier:**

In your Mealvana profile, you set your **maximum carb tolerance** — the most you can comfortably consume per hour without GI distress. We never recommend above this ceiling, even if the workout duration would otherwise call for it.

Research confirms this individual variation is real: a large field study of Ironman competitors found carbohydrate intake ranged from **6 to 136 g/hr** across athletes, with higher intakes correlating to faster finish times [(Pfeiffer et al., 2012, *Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775906/).

*Example:* If you've set your tolerance at 70 g/hr and you're doing a 4-hour ride, we'll recommend 70 g/hr (your max), not the 80-90 g/hr that duration might otherwise suggest.

## Part 2: Why Bike and Run Fueling Are Different

This is one of the most important concepts in triathlon and multisport nutrition: **you can fuel more aggressively on the bike than on the run.**

### The Science

When you run, three things work against your gut:

1. **Mechanical jostling** — Every footstrike sends a shockwave through your GI system
2. **Reduced blood flow** — Running diverts more blood away from your digestive system than cycling at equivalent effort
3. **Body position** — The upright running posture affects gastric emptying differently than cycling's forward lean

These aren't just theoretical concerns. In a study of gastrointestinal symptoms across different sports, Peters et al. (1999) found that *"symptoms are more common in runners than in cyclists"* — with mechanical impact identified as a primary cause [(Peters et al., 1999, *American Journal of Gastroenterology*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10364014/).

The difference becomes dramatic in longer events. Pfeiffer et al. (2012) documented that **severe GI distress occurred in just 4% of marathon runners and cyclists, but in 32% of Ironman competitors** — who must run a marathon after already stressing their gut for 5+ hours on the bike [(Pfeiffer et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775906/).

A systematic review on gastrointestinal distress noted that *"an estimated 30-90% of endurance athletes engaging in marathons, triathlons, and running report experiencing GI symptoms during exercise"* [(ter Steege et al., 2008)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18296320/).

### How This Affects Your Recommendations

Based on this research, Mealvana applies sport-specific adjustments:

| Sport | Practical Carb Ceiling | Evidence Base |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cycling** | 80-120 g/hr | Stable platform, no impact, can eat solids [(Jeukendrup, 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21916794/) |
| **Running** | 50-70 g/hr | GI jostling limits absorption [(Peters et al., 1999)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10364014/) |
| **Swimming** | Pre/post only | Can't fuel during; reduced sweat anyway [(Jeukendrup et al., 2005)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15707379/) |

### The Brick Workout Penalty

If you're doing a brick (bike → run), your run fueling should be even more conservative. Your gut has been working hard on the bike, blood flow patterns are shifting, and the sudden switch to running impact often triggers GI issues.

Research on triathlon-specific nutrition confirms this effect: *"the change in body position among the three disciplines may impair gastric emptying and increase GI distress"* [(Jeukendrup, Jentjens & Moseley, 2005, *Sports Medicine*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15707379/).

A study comparing gel vs. liquid carbohydrate during simulated long-distance triathlon found that **7 of 12 participants reported GI discomfort with gels, while none reported issues with liquid carbs** [(Sareban et al., 2016, *International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26402450/).

**Mealvana automatically reduces your run carb target by 20-30%** when it detects a brick workout pattern in your TrainingPeaks calendar.

*Example:*

- Standalone 90-min tempo run: 55 g/hr recommendation
- 90-min run off a 3-hour bike: 40-45 g/hr recommendation

## Part 3: Sodium — More Personal Than You Think

### Your Sweat Is Unique

Here's a number that might surprise you: **athletes can lose anywhere from 200 to 2,000 mg of sodium per liter of sweat**. That's a 10x difference between the saltiest and least salty sweaters.

This massive range has been documented across multiple studies. Baker et al. (2016) analyzed 506 athletes and found sweat sodium concentrations ranging from **230 to 1,840 mg/L, with a mean of 826 mg/L** [(Baker et al., 2016, *Sports Medicine*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28332114/).

Your sweat sodium concentration is largely genetic — you're either a salty sweater or you're not. Heat acclimation helps reduce it somewhat, but the range between individuals remains enormous [(Baker et al., 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28332114/).

### How Mealvana Calculates Your Sodium Needs

**The formula:**

```
Sodium Loss (mg/hr) = Sweat Rate (L/hr) × Sweat Sodium Concentration (mg/L)
```

This approach aligns with the ACSM Position Stand on Exercise and Fluid Replacement: *"Because there is considerable variability in sweating rates and sweat electrolyte content between individuals, customized fluid replacement programs are recommended"* [(Sawka et al., 2007, *Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277604/).

**Example — Two Athletes, Same Workout:**

| Athlete | Sweat Rate | Sodium Concentration | Hourly Loss |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sarah | 1.2 L/hr | 900 mg/L | 1,080 mg/hr |
| Marcus | 1.8 L/hr | 1,400 mg/L | 2,520 mg/hr |

Marcus loses more than **twice** as much sodium as Sarah in the same workout. Their fueling plans need to reflect this.

This isn't just academic. Baker et al. (2019) demonstrated significant sport-specific differences in sodium losses, with American football and endurance athletes showing the greatest need for deliberate replacement strategies [(Baker et al., 2019, *Journal of Sports Sciences*)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2019.1633159).

### Setting Your Profile

In Mealvana, you can input:

- **Sweat rate** (L/hr) — Measure by weighing yourself before and after a 1-hour workout
- **Sodium loss rate** (mg/L) — From a sweat test, or use our estimate based on your description

If you haven't done a formal sweat test, we use research-based defaults from Baker et al. (2016):

- Average sweat sodium: ~900 mg/L
- Range for "salty sweater" profile: 1,200-1,500 mg/L
- Range for "light sweater" profile: 400-600 mg/L

### Sodium Replacement Guidelines

How much should you replace? Research suggests targeting 50-80% replacement during exercise is both practical and effective. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends **500-700 mg of sodium per liter of fluid** for ultra-endurance events [(Tiller et al., 2019, *Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31182071/).

For hot/humid conditions (>25°C and/or >60% humidity), intake should increase to **300-600 mg sodium per hour** [(Tiller et al., 2019)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31182071/).

---

## Part 4: Fluid — Matching Your Sweat Rate

### The Goal

The research consensus is clear: **don't lose more than 2-3% of your body weight from dehydration during exercise**. Beyond that threshold, performance drops measurably [(Sawka et al., 2007)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277604/).

But here's the flip side: **don't over-drink either**. Hyponatremia (dangerously low blood sodium from drinking too much plain water) is a real risk in long events, particularly marathons and Ironman races [(Hew-Butler et al., 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26102448/).

### Sweat Rate Variability

Just like sodium concentration, sweat rates vary dramatically. The research documents a range of **0.5 to 2.5+ L/hr** depending on:

- Exercise intensity
- Environmental conditions (heat, humidity)
- Body size
- Fitness level and heat acclimation
- Genetics

[(Baker et al., 2016, *Sports Medicine*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28332114/)

### How Mealvana Calculates Fluid Targets

We start with your sweat rate and apply a practical replacement factor:

```
Fluid Target (ml/hr) = Sweat Rate (L/hr) × 1000 × Replacement Factor (0.7-0.9)
```

The replacement factor accounts for:

1. Some fluid produced from metabolism
2. Perfect 100% replacement isn't necessary or practical
3. You'll consume additional fluid with food

**Environmental Adjustments:**

Research documents significant environmental effects on sweat rate and fluid needs:

| Condition | Fluid Adjustment | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hot (>25°C / 77°F) | +25-40% | [Tiller et al., 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31182071/) |
| Humid (>70%) | +20-30% | [Sawka et al., 2007](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17277604/) |
| Cold (<10°C / 50°F) | -30-50% | Reduced but not eliminated sweat |
| Indoor trainer (no wind) | +30-50% | No convective cooling dramatically increases sweat |
| Altitude (>2000m) | +15-25% | Increased respiratory water loss |

That indoor trainer adjustment is no joke — without wind cooling, sweat rates can nearly double. A German position statement on fluid replacement notes that athletes should pay particular attention to hydration during indoor training [(Mosler et al., 2020, *German Journal of Sports Medicine*)](https://www.germanjournalsportsmedicine.com/fileadmin/content/archiv2020/Heft_7-8-9/DtschZSportmed_Position_Stand_Mosler_Fluid_Replacement_in_Sports_2020-7-8-9.pdf).

## Part 5: Putting It All Together — A Worked Example

Let's walk through how Mealvana generates a fueling plan for a real workout.

### The Workout

**Olympic Triathlon Race**

- Swim: 1.5 km (~25 min)
- Bike: 40 km (~65 min)
- Run: 10 km (~50 min)
- Total: ~2:20

### The Athlete Profile

- Weight: 68 kg
- Sweat rate: 1.3 L/hr
- Sweat sodium: 1,100 mg/L
- Max carb tolerance: 80 g/hr
- GI sensitivity: Low
- Caffeine sensitive: No

### The Calculation

**Swim Leg:**

- Duration: 25 min
- Fueling: None (can't eat while swimming)
- Note: Reduced sweat in water (~50% of land rate) — documented in triathlon-specific research [(Jeukendrup et al., 2005)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15707379/)

**Bike Leg:**

- Duration: 65 min
- Intensity: Race pace (high)
- Base carb recommendation: 60-75 g/hr for this duration/intensity [(Burke et al., 2011)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21916794/)
- Athlete tolerance: 80 g/hr (not limiting)
- **Bike carb target: 60-70 g total (~55-65 g/hr)**
- Sodium: 1.3 L/hr × 1,100 mg/L × 1.08 hr = ~1,540 mg
- Fluid: 1.3 L/hr × 0.85 × 1.08 hr = ~1,200 ml

**T2 Transition:**

- Quick gel (25g carb) + electrolyte sip
- This is your last easy fueling opportunity

**Run Leg:**

- Duration: 50 min
- Intensity: Race pace
- Base carb recommendation: 40-50 g/hr for 50-min race effort
- **Brick penalty applied:** This is coming off bike, reduce by 20% [(Jeukendrup et al., 2005)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15707379/)
- **Run carb target: 30-40 g total**
- Sodium: ~700 mg
- Fluid: ~500 ml (from aid stations)

### Final Race Nutrition Plan

| Segment | Carbs | Sodium | Fluid | Products |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Pre-race (3hr before) | 80-100g | — | 500ml | Breakfast + top-up |
| Pre-race (10min before) | 25g | 200mg | 150ml | Gel + sips |
| Swim | — | — | — | — |
| T1 | — | — | Quick sip | — |
| Bike | 60-70g | 1,500mg | 1,200ml | 2 bottles drink mix + 1 gel |
| T2 | 25g | 200mg | 100ml | Gel + electrolyte sip |
| Run | 30-40g | 700mg | 500ml | 1-2 gels + aid station cups |
| **TOTAL** | 220-260g | 2,600mg | 2.5L | — |

## Part 6: Why Mealvana Is More Than a Lookup Table

You might be thinking: "This is just a table lookup. Duration goes in, carb recommendation comes out." But that's exactly what we *don't* do. Here's how Mealvana's approach differs from the static tables you'll find in textbooks and generic sports nutrition guides.

### 1. Continuous Functions, Not Arbitrary Cutoffs

Traditional guidelines use step functions with hard cutoffs:

| Duration | Traditional Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| 45-60 min | 30 g/hr |
| 60-90 min | 30-60 g/hr |
| 90-150 min | 60-90 g/hr |

See the problem? A 59-minute workout gets one recommendation. A 61-minute workout jumps to a completely different range. **Your body doesn't work in 60-minute increments.**

Mealvana uses **continuous algorithms** that smoothly scale recommendations across the full duration spectrum. A 59-minute workout and a 61-minute workout get nearly identical recommendations — because physiologically, they're nearly identical workouts.

The same applies to intensity. We don't suddenly flip a switch at "Zone 3 vs. Zone 4." We use your actual workout intensity (from TrainingPeaks TSS and IF data) to calculate recommendations on a smooth curve.

### 2. We Learn From Your Feedback

Research provides population-level ranges. But you're not a population — you're an individual.

When you log a workout and tell us:

- "Fueling felt perfect"
- "Stomach was a bit off"
- "Bonked at mile 18"
- "Could have eaten more"

...we learn. Over time, Mealvana **narrows your personal band** from the wide population range down to what actually works for *you*.

*Example:*

- Population range for a 3-hour ride: 60-90 g/hr
- After 10 logged rides with feedback: Your personalized range: 70-80 g/hr

This is the difference between generic advice and a system that knows *you* — your gut, your preferences, your tolerance.

### 3. Weight-Scaled Recommendations

Here's something most tables ignore: body size matters.

A 55 kg runner and an 85 kg runner doing the same workout have different absolute needs. While carbohydrate oxidation rates are largely gut-limited (not body-size-limited), other factors do scale:

- **Fluid needs** scale with body surface area and sweat rate
- **Sodium losses** scale with sweat volume
- **Absolute glycogen stores** are larger in bigger athletes
- **Practical tolerance** often correlates with body size

Mealvana applies **weight-based scaling** within each recommendation band:

- Lower-weight athletes start toward the lower end of ranges
- Higher-weight athletes start toward the upper end

This isn't just about being bigger — it's about calibrating to your physiology from day one, then refining from there.

### 4. Multi-Variable Integration

Traditional tables handle one or two variables. Mealvana integrates **all of them simultaneously**:

| Variable | How We Use It |
| --- | --- |
| Duration | Primary driver of total carb need |
| Intensity (TSS/IF) | Modifies carb utilization rate |
| Sport type | Bike vs. run vs. swim algorithms |
| Your carb tolerance | Hard ceiling on recommendations |
| Your sweat rate | Drives fluid/sodium targets |
| Your sodium concentration | Personalizes electrolyte needs |
| Environmental conditions | Heat/cold/humidity/altitude adjustments |
| Workout context | Brick penalties, back-to-back days |
| Training phase | Taper week carb loading vs. base building |

No lookup table can handle this complexity. We calculate your recommendations fresh for every workout, with every variable weighted appropriately.

### 5. Training Context Awareness

Your Monday long run and your Friday long run might be identical on paper — but if you've done hard sessions Tuesday through Thursday, your Friday needs are different.

Mealvana reads your full TrainingPeaks calendar, not just the individual workout. We know:

- **Back-to-back hard days:** Emphasize recovery nutrition and glycogen replenishment
- **Taper week:** Carb loading protocols for the final days before your race
- **Build phase:** Standard fueling, focus on training the gut
- **Two-a-days:** Adjusted recovery windows between sessions

### 6. Ranges, Not False Precision

You'll notice Mealvana gives you ranges (60-75 g/hr) rather than single numbers (67.3 g/hr).

This is intentional. The research gives us ranges. Your individual response varies day to day. Weather changes. Stress affects your gut. That gel you usually love might taste terrible at mile 20.

We give you a **target band** — precise enough to be actionable, honest enough to acknowledge uncertainty. Aim for the middle, and you have room to adjust based on how you feel.

### 7. Race Mode vs. Training Mode

A Tuesday tempo run and an A-race have different stakes — and should have different fueling strategies.

In **training mode**, we're slightly conservative:

- Room to experiment
- Building gut tolerance gradually
- Okay to occasionally under-fuel and learn from it

In **race mode**, we're appropriately aggressive:

- Maximize performance within your proven tolerance
- Pre-race protocols optimized for topping off glycogen
- Contingency plans for GI distress

When you mark a workout as a race in TrainingPeaks, Mealvana shifts its recommendations accordingly.

---

## Part 7: Training Your Gut

Here's something the research has proven: **your gut adapts to what you ask of it**.

A landmark study by Cox et al. (2010) showed that athletes who trained with high carbohydrate intake for 28 days significantly increased their ability to absorb and oxidize carbs during exercise. The high-carb group showed *"higher exogenous carbohydrate oxidation rates during exercise than the low-carb group"* — attributed to improved intestinal absorption [(Cox et al., 2010, *Journal of Applied Physiology*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20466803/).

This adaptation appears to involve upregulation of intestinal transporters (SGLT1 and GLUT5), meaning your gut literally builds more "lanes" for carbohydrate absorption with training [(Jeukendrup, 2017)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28332114/).

As Jeukendrup summarized: *"The gut is highly adaptable and endurance athletes should incorporate nutritional training into their training plans"* [(Jeukendrup & McLaughlin, 2011, *Nestlé Nutrition Institute Workshop Series*)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22152948/).

### What This Means for You

1. **Start conservative** — If you're new to fueling during exercise, begin at 40-50 g/hr
2. **Build gradually** — Add 5-10 g/hr every few weeks
3. **Practice race nutrition in training** — Never try anything new on race day
4. **Use training sessions to test tolerance** — Long rides are perfect for gut training

A systematic review on gut training concluded that *"repeated exposure to high carbohydrate intake during training can impact physiological outcomes; specifically, substrate utilization"* and can help prevent GI distress [(Costa et al., 2023, *Sports Medicine*)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40279-023-01841-0).

Mealvana tracks your training history and will gradually suggest higher carb targets as you demonstrate tolerance over time.

## Part 8: When Things Go Wrong — GI Distress

Even with perfect planning, GI issues happen. Research suggests several risk factors, which Mealvana accounts for in its recommendations.

### Known Risk Factors for GI Distress

Studies have identified several dietary and non-dietary correlates of GI distress during endurance events:

| Risk Factor | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| History of GI issues | Strongest predictor (ρ = 0.32-0.51) [(Pfeiffer et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21775906/) |
| High fiber intake pre-race | Increases symptoms [(Rehrer et al., 1992)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1386594/) |
| High fat/protein pre-race | Delays gastric emptying [(Rehrer et al., 1992)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1386594/) |
| Concentrated carb solutions (>8%) | Increases GI distress [(de Oliveira et al., 2014)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24458896/) |
| NSAIDs (ibuprofen, etc.) | Compromises gut barrier [(Van Wijck et al., 2012)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22450853/) |
| Dehydration | Exacerbates symptoms [(Rehrer et al., 1992)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1386594/) |

*Source: [Wilson, 2015, International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26222930/)*

### Red Flags That Trigger Conservative Recommendations

| Factor | Mealvana Adjustment |
| --- | --- |
| GI sensitivity: High | Reduce carb ceiling by 20-30% |
| First race at this distance | Conservative fueling, liquid calories preferred |
| Hot conditions | Reduce carbs slightly, increase sodium/fluid |
| Brick run | Reduce run carbs by 20-30% |
| Caffeine sensitive | Remove caffeine from recommendations |

### The Backup Plan

For long races (70.3 and Ironman), Mealvana generates a **GI distress contingency** based on field experience from ultra-endurance research:

- If nausea hits: Switch to cola + broth only [(Stuempfle & Hoffman, 2015)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25811308/)
- Walk aid stations to allow digestion
- Reduce intake to 30 g/hr until symptoms resolve
- Prioritize hydration over calories

## The Bottom Line

Your Mealvana nutrition plan isn't a guess — it's built on:

✓ **Peer-reviewed research** from leading sports nutrition scientists

✓ **Your personal profile** (weight, sweat rate, sodium loss, carb tolerance)

✓ **Your specific workout** (duration, intensity, sport type)

✓ **Environmental conditions** (heat, humidity, altitude)

✓ **Smart adjustments** (brick penalties, GI sensitivity, caffeine restrictions)

The goal is simple: **give you enough fuel to perform your best, without giving you so much that your stomach rebels.**

Every recommendation comes with the reasoning behind it, so you understand not just *what* to eat, but *why*. Because the more you understand your fueling, the better you can adapt when race day throws you a curveball.
