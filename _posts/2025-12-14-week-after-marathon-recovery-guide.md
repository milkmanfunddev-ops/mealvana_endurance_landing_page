<p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;">You did it — 26.2 miles of grit, patience, and heart. The finish-line glow is real… but so is the deep, whole-body fatigue that follows. Understanding what's happening physiologically in the 7 days after a marathon helps you recover faster, lower injury risk, and return to running smarter.</p>

### Quick Symptom Checklist (Totally Normal)

**What you might feel in the first week:**

- Low energy / "battery drained"
- "Hollow" hunger (even after eating)
- Brain fog or mood dip
- Heavy legs + stiffness (especially stairs)
- Sniffles / scratchy throat
- Random twinges in ankles, knees, hips

### What Happens to Your Body After a Marathon

#### 1) Muscle damage peaks in the first 48 hours

A marathon creates thousands of microscopic tears in muscle fibers and connective tissue. Blood markers of muscle damage (like creatine kinase) often rise sharply and can stay elevated for several days. [1,2]

**What you feel:**
- Heavy legs
- Stiffness going downstairs
- Soreness that "moves around"

This is normal — it's tissue repair in progress.

#### 2) Glycogen stores are severely depleted

Even with great fueling, a marathon can leave muscle glycogen low. Your body prioritizes restoring it in the first 24 hours, and delaying carbs slows the refueling process. [3,4]

**What you feel:**
- Low energy
- "Hollow" hunger
- Brain fog

#### 3) Your immune system takes a temporary hit

Hard endurance racing can temporarily shift immune function, including measurable drops in salivary IgA (a key "front-line" mucosal antibody). That's one reason runners often feel more susceptible to colds shortly after a marathon. [5,6]

**What you feel:**
- Feeling run-down
- Scratchy throat or sniffles
- Fatigue that feels "deeper than soreness"

#### 4) Tendons & joints may lag behind muscles

Muscle soreness can improve quickly, but tendon and connective-tissue remodeling is slower and responds differently to load. [7] And newer imaging work suggests that collagen within the Achilles tendon can show measurable structural changes after running, reinforcing why easing back matters. [8]

**What you feel:**
- Stiff ankles or knees
- Slight instability
- "Twinges" that come and go

#### 5) Hormones & sleep can be disrupted

A marathon is a major stressor: cortisol can spike and then normalize over the next day, but sleep disruption is still common in the immediate post-race window (especially when soreness, travel, nerves, or inflammation are in the mix). [9,10]

#### 6) The emotional dip is real

Many runners experience a "post-race emotional paradox": pride + relief, but also anxiety, flatness, or loss of routine. That's a documented, common post-endurance experience. [11]

### What Runners Should Do the Week After a Marathon

#### Day 0–2: Full reset mode

- **Walk, don't run.** Gentle movement increases circulation without adding damage.
- **Carbs + protein at every meal.** (See targets below.)
- **Hydrate + sodium.** You're still catching up from race-day losses.
- **Compression + elevation** if swelling is noticeable.
- **Avoid "just in case" NSAIDs.** Some evidence suggests common NSAIDs can blunt muscle protein synthesis and satellite-cell activity after exercise, and endurance events plus NSAIDs can raise kidney-risk in some settings. [12–14]

#### Day 3–4: Active recovery begins

- Light bike / swim / elliptical (20–30 min, truly easy).
- Mobility + gentle yoga (hips, glutes, calves, lower back).
- Sleep is the assignment.

#### Day 5–7: Slow return to running

- Optional: 15–20 min EASY on soft surfaces (conversation pace).
- Run/walk is fine.
- Light strength only if pain-free (core + glute activation).
- **Watch for red flags:** sharp pain, worsening limp, swelling, unusual fatigue → stop and reassess.

Most runners feel noticeably better by days 7–14. The biggest recovery "hack" is not rushing days 1–4.

### What to Eat to Speed Recovery

**Carbs**
Prioritize carbs early to refill glycogen efficiently. [3,4]

**Protein**
Aim for steady protein to support repair.

**Color + omega-3s**
Fruits/veg and omega-3-rich foods support overall recovery (and make it easier to eat enough when appetite is weird).

### The Bottom Line

Your body just did something extraordinary. The fastest way to recover isn't pushing through — it's respecting the repair process.

Walk for 2–3 days, eat intentionally, sleep deeply, and ease back slowly. You'll return stronger — and you'll actually enjoy your next start line.
